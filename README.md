# GENDER-RECOGNITION-BY-VOICE
Determining a person’s gender as male or female, based upon a sample of their voice.


##### **Company Introduction**

Your client for this project is a Telecom company.

-   They are a leading telecom company with 5 million users.
-   They want to keep track of the number of male and female users but as the user count increases the task becomes more tedious.
-   They want to automate the process of keeping track of male and female users using their voice.
-   Their research and development teams are trying to understand the acoustic properties of the voice and speech so that they can use it to enhance the customer experience in their new product.

  

##### **Current Scenario**

-   Determining a person’s gender as male or female, based upon a sample of their voice, initially seems to be an easy task.
-   Often, the human ear can easily detect the difference between a male or a female voice within the first few spoken words.
-   However, designing a computer program to do this turns out to be a bit trickier.
-   Currently, the company is keeping track by manually entering the data for the user being male or female by listening to their voice which is a tedious task for the employees.
